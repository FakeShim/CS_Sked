            I am a senior computer science student and also a part of UA's STEM
            Path to the MBA program. I have done self study projects in data science
            and machine learning. So I have experience in C, C++, Python, and Java.
            I have been a part of the Crimson Defense  Cyber Security Club since
            Freshman year and am currently President of the Crimson Smash Club.

            I am a senior computer science student with over a year and a half
            of co-op experience under my belt. I worked with Neptune Technology
            Group over the course of 2022, as well as the summer of 2023. Through
            this co-op I was able to experience a genuine work environment, and
            as such learned about C, C++, git, docker, many different software
            development tools, such as Bitbucket, TeamCity and Jira. I also got
            very familiar with the Agile development process.

            I am a senior computer science major. I have experience in C/C++ and
            Python because of my time here at UA. Most of my time is spent with
            the Asian American Student Association, where I am the co-director
            of recruitment. During my time there, I enjoyed making new connections
            and experiences while making sure others feel the same.

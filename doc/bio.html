            I am a senior computer science student with over a year and a half
            of co-op experience under my belt. I worked with Neptune Technology
            Group over the course of 2022, as well as the summer of 2023. Through
            this co-op I was able to experience a genuine work environment, and
            as such learned about C, C++, git, docker, many different software
            development tools, such as Bitbucket, TeamCity and Jira. I also got
            very familiar with the Agile development process.
